# Wave Function Collapse Cave Generator (in Unity)

This simple project, created for the course of Procedural Generation, Malmö University, 2025, implements a Wave Function Collapse (WFC)–based cave generation system for Unity. 

It procedurally generates 2D cave maps where each tile conforms to local adjacency rules, ensuring organically connected and consistent structures.
The algorithm works by collapsing cells with the lowest entropy first, applying constraint propagation to enforce neighbor compatibility. This results in dynamic, natural-looking cave patterns that vary on each run but always remain valid. Propagation spreads changes in a wave-like manner, producing smooth transitions between open corridors and solid walls.
